# QUIZGEN

this is a hacky set of python scripts to automatically create BlackBoard
questions

quizgen.py is the bit that does the "hard" work, containing functions for
creating fill-in-the-blank and multiple choice questions

caesar.py is an example of a program which creates some fill-in-the-blank questions involving Caesar ciphers of different shifts

pwentropycalc.py is another example of a program which creates some multiple choice questions based upon the calculation of entropy for passwords
